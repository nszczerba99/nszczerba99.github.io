says:
  - "Someone almost always backs out: it turns out he can’t afford it after all or is missing some hiking gear which is also expensive."
  - "Sometimes there are miscommunications: e.g. someone understood that expenses would be lower"
  - Because we communicate basically on 3 different messenger group chats some information might get lost or someone might easily misunderstand something.
  - Everyone tracks their savings individually
  - When you commit to going on a trip, everyone just assumes you’re going to come up with money by the designated time.
thinks:
  - His group’s process of organizing a trip is disorganized and chaotic
  - His group’s way of communicating is ineffective and chaotic
  - Would like to have a space where information about the trip, e.g. the exact sum for it, would be visible for everyone to see at all times
does:
  - He and his friends find a hiking spot, then usually one friend starts organizing a trip and communicating expenses to others
  - They communicate on 3 different messenger group chats
  - Everyone in group tracks their savings individually
  - He doesn’t diligently track his savings, just roughly estimates the date when he’ll gather the needed sum
  - They don’t track others’ savings nor communicate the progress in a group

feels:
  - Annoyed by himself and his friends for being disorganized when planning and saving for the trip
  - Frustrated, disappointed, let down by his friends when they back out of a trip
