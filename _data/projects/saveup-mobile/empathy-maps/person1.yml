says:
  - We roughly calculated once how many months it would take to gather such a sum, but it is a prediction very far in the future and it may not be entirely accurate
  - We have the Excel sheet with all the calculations and predicted goal reach date saved somewhere but I haven’t looked at it for some time.
  - I’ve already forgotten the predicted date when we would have the money for the apartment.
  - Once a month we have to review our savings which can be a lengthy process
thinks:
  - Distrusts his expense calculations, doesn’t think they’re accurate anymore
  - Doubts if they’ll ever reach their goal
  - Already forgotten the predicted goal reach date
  - Doesn’t like the process of monthly expense analysis
does:
  - Enrolled in a bootcamp to get a better-paying job
  - Tries to save money on food, transportation, vacation etc.
  - Made an excel sheet with expense calculations and predicted goal reach date
  - Every month (after paycheck) he and his boyfriend review savings in their bank accounts using a bank app feature which shows how much money you have this month compared to previous months
  - Then they transfer saved money to separate savings accounts and compare the saved sum with the goal sum, often using a calculator 
feels:
  - Discouraged and lacking motivation
  - Doubtful about reaching their goal
  - Tired of and bothered by their monthly expense analysis
