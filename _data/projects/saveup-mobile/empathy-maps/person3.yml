says:
  - I am the family's treasurer and every now and then (I don’t really have a schedule but rather do it on impulse) I check with every family member how much in savings they currently have
  - Asking my family members about their savings every time can be a nuisance, I wish I had a way of just knowing it at all times.
  - Having to brainstorm our trip options requires a lot of thinking and calculating. And It’s even harder when you have dyslexia!
thinks:
  - Wishes she had a way of knowing her family’s savings at all times instead of asking every member individually every time
  - Doesn’t like researching trip offers based on discovered amount of savings every time, it's too time and energy consuming for her
does:
  - All family members have savings accounts for trips and every month a scheduled transaction puts a fraction of one’s earnings towards it.
  - Every now and then (acts on an impulse) she checks with every family member the amount of their savings.
  - Then she calculates which trip they can afford and how much longer they have to save for a trip around the world.
feels:
  - Tired, burdened by brainstorming family’s trip options every time
  - Disrupted by unexpected circumstances like daughter pulling out her savings for a summer house -  it creates chaos, requires recalculating, replanning everything
  - Frustrated when researching trip options with dyslexia, feels that her needs don’t matter
  - Sometimes doubtful that her dream of a trip around the world will come true
