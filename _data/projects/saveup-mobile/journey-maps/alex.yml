      I’m also feeling imaginative, coming up with activities and places we could explore.

    tasks:
      - Research the costs of accommodations, flights, and other essential expenses.

    feelings: >
      The required expenses are higher than expected, and neither my friends nor I can afford the trip right now.
      I’m starting to feel doubtful about whether the trip will work out, which is disappointing since I’m so excited about it.

    feelings: >
      I feel a bit unsure about whether I’ve chosen the right app. I want something simple that won’t overcomplicate things for my friends.
      I also value privacy—I don’t want to share my exact salary, expenses, or savings with others.

      - Monitor the savings progress while waiting for the total amount to be gathered.
    feelings: >
      The app is easy to use, and most of my friends appreciate it. We’re all relieved to avoid awkward conversations about money.
      However, a few friends are skeptical and worried about sharing personal financial details, even though the app feels secure.
    improvements:

      - Option to link savings accounts or set recurring savings/expenses.
