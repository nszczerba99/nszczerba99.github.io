# SaveUp Responsive Website

The ***SaveUp* responsive website** was an extension of my [***SaveUp* mobile app** project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2-saveup-mobile-app), both created as part of my coursework for the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate**. Building on the same concept of helping **groups** collaboratively **save for a shared goal**, this project focused on **translating** the mobile app experience into a **fully responsive website** - ensuring **accessibility across all devices and screen sizes**.

## The challenge

The challenge in this project mirrored the [mobile app project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2-saveup-mobile-app). However, this time, the goal was to adapt the concept into a fully responsive website.

    <p><em>Design a responsive website that helps friend or family groups manage a household budget and save up for a common goal (such as a vacation).</em></p>
</blockquote>

## My role

As this project was a continuation of my **coursework**, I managed the **complete design process** from beginning to end. This involved **conducting user research**, crafting the **app's structure and interactions**, **wireframing**, **prototyping** and refining the **user interface** with careful attention to color, typography, and visual design.

## Target users

Back in the [mobile app project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2-saveup-mobile-app) I identified **two** distinct target users: **Alex and Sofia**.

    </div>

        {% include animated-image.liquid src="https://i.imgur.com/a24hsSe.png" alt="User persona: Sofia" %}
    </div>
</div>

Below are Alex and Sofia's **user stories**.

## Sitemap

First, I had to decide what the **sitemap** should be. I've decided to make the **navigation** focused on key elements: a ***Goals*** page listing all **group goals**, a ***My Transactions*** space for tracking **personal savings**, a ***Help*** section with **FAQs** and **contact support** options, and an ***Account*** section for **logging out or adjusting settings**.

## Paper wireframes

I sketched out paper wireframes, keeping in mind the target users' needs and pain points. The **home screen** went through **four variations** before I decided on the final version.

I used **stars** to **highlight** the elements in each sketch that I felt were best suited for the final version. Below is the **final** version made of those starred elements, along with the **small-screen variation**.

## Digital wireframes

Moving from paper to **digital wireframes** reassured me in the layout I came up with and allowed me to add more detail, refining elements that didn’t quite fit on paper.

## Usability study

From the wireframes, I built a **low-fidelity prototype**, which I then used in a **usability study**.

### Key insights

The study revealed the following **key insights**:

## Final designs

After the **usability study**, I designed **mockups** that incorporated key insights, ensuring that all **pain points** were addressed in the final designs. The **visual design** elements - such as the **color palette, typography, and iconography** - were directly carried over from the [mobile app project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2-saveup-mobile-app), with a few additions and refinements.

Below are the **mockups**, presented in both **large and small screen variations** to showcase the design's responsiveness and adaptability.

### High-fidelity prototype

Building on the mockups, I created a **high-fidelity prototype** that brings the design to life, showcasing the app's functionality, user flow, and overall experience.

## Takeaways

### Designing for responsiveness
I learned how to build **responsive websites**, carefully considering how **layouts** should adapt across different **devices**. I enjoyed working with **screen breakpoints**, ensuring that the website remained **accessible** and functional at every size.  

### Exploring sitemap variations
I spent a significant amount of time researching and deciding on the **sitemap structure**, exploring different **variations** and their impact on **navigation**. This process helped me recognize the diverse approaches used in **web design** - many of which I had encountered before but hadn’t fully analyzed or appreciated.  

### Prioritizing accessibility
I gained valuable insights into **accessibility considerations**, such as using **annotations** to guide engineers on **tab order** or proper **heading hierarchy**. This experience shifted my mindset, making me more conscious of how designs are perceived by **assistive technologies**. I now regularly ask myself, *"How would a screen reader interpret this?"* when making **design decisions**.
